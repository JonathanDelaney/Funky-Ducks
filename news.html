            next day, their music makes you dance until you drop. Their Funky
            Tones are reminiscent of a bygone era. Stevie Wonder, Sly and the

          <p>
            This year the world was brought to its knees by the challenge that
            has been the pandemic. It has disrupted all industries and the music
            one was no exception. There have been few things to be more grateful
            for at this time than our health. This doesn't make the plight of
            our smal/independant artists any less serious. Those involved in
            transport and set-up and all those whose livelihood depends on
            things comtinuing as they were are struggling. Please support them
            by buying tickets!
